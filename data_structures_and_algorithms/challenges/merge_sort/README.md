Author: `Ahmad Swedani`

## Challenge

Review the provided pseudocode then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Space complexity Big O(n)
- Time complexity Big O(n\*log(n))
